git-commit-hooks
================

A repository to mantain our commit hooks that we use across our project to mantain consistency across our repositories. We use hooks in order to validate our commits in respect of the bug tracking system we are using.

These hooks are currently available:
* [FogBugz compatible hook](fogbugz/README.md)
* ...and that's it for the time being :)
